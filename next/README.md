# Description
This folder contains the next upcoming release of the main folder and can be used for inspection by pointing ebusd to the base folder with the "--configpath=https://ebus.github.io/next/" argument to ebusd.

The source files are taken from the commit associated with the submodule [ebusd-configuration-next](../ebusd-configuration-next) here and the mapping from those to the generated CSV files is also re-generated with each update and [documented here](mapping.md).
